# house-web-crawler
A SaaS in GoLang that has a REST API that easily looks for an apartment/house rental contract via a web crawler that collects the latest info from several websites with rental contracts.

Made by Adam Jacobs and Olle Bergl√∂f.

TODO:

- Implement more crawls to new house listing websites.

- Refine REST api if needed

- Investigate how often the db should be updated.

- Connect API to front end.

- Design simple front end. More info comes soon.
